### One goal: Cook Tomato Pasta. easy, right?

 However, this is a kitchen with weird, wacky rules, and the restaurant owner has had No Time To Explain! So it's up to you to either try and interpret the owners extremely fast instructions, or try out combinations for yourself .

Mix, Cook, Wash,  Explode, Diffuse Bombs, Flood the kitchen. Accessibility,  Screen Resolution, and Audio settings are added to make the experience best for everyone. Good Luck!
